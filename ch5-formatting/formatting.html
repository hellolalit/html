			<h2>B Tag (bold tag) and Strong Tag -</h2>
			<p>What is a "b tag" ?</p>
			<p>
				The "b" tag specifies bold text without any extra importance. In html,
				there are 2 types of bold tags. "b" and "strong" tags. "b" tags just
				makes the text bold and does not specifies any importance of that bold
				text where as "strong" tag does! This is made for seo purpose so that
				search engine can understand the importance of bold text accordingly and
				do it's task!
			</p>

			<br />

			<p>Let's Take an example below -</p>

			<br />
			<p>
				<b>Windows</b> is good for daily work but has
				<strong> privacy and security issues.</strong> So, inorder to counter
				that, we have <strong>Linux</strong> as an alternative!
			</p>

			<br />

			<p>
				In the above example, Windows is in bold text but does not has so much
				importance whereas Linux and privacy and security issues has! So, when
				we need to add importance to any bold text, we will use "strong" tag
				else "b" tag.
			</p>
			<br />
			<br />
			<h2>I tag and EM tag -</h2>

			<h3>What is "i" tag?</h3>
			<p>
				The "i" tag in HTML is used to display the content in italic style. This
				tag is generally used to display the technical term, phrase, the
				important word in a different language.
			</p>

			<h3>What is "em" tag?</h3>
			<p>
				The "em" tag is also one of the elements of HTML used in formatting
				texts. It is used to define emphasized text or statements.
			</p>

			<h3>What is the difference then?</h3>
			<p>
				"i" Tag is like putting something in italics just for looks, while "em"
				Tag is for adding real emphasis or importance to the text, indicating
				that it should be read with more attention. They may both look
				italicized but "em" have a meaning beyond appearance.
				<br />
				<strong>Note:</strong> By default, the visual result is the same. The
				main difference between these two tags is that the "em" tag semantically
				emphasizes the important word or section of words while the "i" tag is
				just offset text conventionally styled in italics to show an alternative
				mood or voice.
			</p>

			<h2>Mark Tag-</h2>

			<p>
				The "mark" tag in HTML is used to define the marked text. It is used to
				highlight the part of the text in a paragraph. The "mark" tag is new in
				HTML 5.
			</p>

			<p><strong>Example -</strong></p>

			<p>

				opensource so it brough github then introduced MS Azure and now
				development is also done on windows instead of Linux!
			</p>
			<br />
			<br />

			<h2>DEL Tag-</h2>
			<h3>What is Del Tag ?</h3>
			<p>
				HTML "del" Tag is used to mark a portion of text that has been deleted
				from the document. The deleted text is rendered as strike-through text
				by the web browsers although this property can be changed using CSS
				text-decoration property. The "del" tag requires a starting and ending
