            <h2>B Tag (bold tag) and Strong Tag</h2>
            <p>What is a "b tag"?</p>
            <p>
                The "b" tag specifies bold text without any extra importance. In HTML,
                there are two types of bold tags: "b" and "strong" tags. "b" tags just
                make the text bold and do not specify any importance of that bold
                text, whereas "strong" tags do! This is made for SEO purposes so that
                search engines can understand the importance of bold text accordingly and
                do their task!
            </p>

            <br />

            <p>Let's take an example below:</p>

            <br />
            <p>
                <b>Windows</b> is good for daily work but has
                <strong>privacy and security issues.</strong> So, in order to counter
                that, we have <strong>Linux</strong> as an alternative!
            </p>

            <br />

            <p>
                In the above example, Windows is in bold text but does not have much
                importance, whereas Linux and privacy and security issues do! So, when
                we need to add importance to any bold text, we will use the "strong" tag
                instead of the "b" tag.
            </p>
            <br />
            <br />
            <h2>I Tag and EM Tag</h2>

            <h3>What is the "i" tag?</h3>
            <p>
                The "i" tag in HTML is used to display the content in italic style. This
                tag is generally used to display technical terms, phrases, or
                important words in a different language.
            </p>

            <h3>What is the "em" tag?</h3>
            <p>
                The "em" tag is also one of the elements of HTML used in formatting
                texts. It is used to define emphasized text or statements.
            </p>

            <h3>What is the difference then?</h3>
            <p>
                The "i" tag is like putting something in italics just for looks, while the "em"
                tag is for adding real emphasis or importance to the text, indicating
                that it should be read with more attention. They may both look
                italicized, but "em" has a meaning beyond appearance.
                <br />
                <strong>Note:</strong> By default, the visual result is the same. The
                main difference between these two tags is that the "em" tag semantically
                emphasizes the important word or section of words, while the "i" tag is
                just offset text conventionally styled in italics to show an alternative
                mood or voice.
            </p>

            <br />
            <br />

            <h2>Mark Tag</h2>
            <h3>What is the Mark Tag?</h3>
            <p>
                The "mark" tag in HTML is used to define the marked text. It is used to
                highlight part of the text in a paragraph. The "mark" tag is new in
                HTML 5.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

            <p>
                <mark>Microsoft's biggest plan was to kill Linux</mark> by buying
                open-source software, so it bought GitHub, then introduced MS Azure, and now
                development is also done on Windows instead of Linux!
            </p>
            <br />
            <br />

            <h2>DEL Tag</h2>
            <h3>What is the Del Tag?</h3>
            <p>
                The HTML "del" tag is used to mark a portion of text that has been deleted
                from the document. The deleted text is rendered as strike-through text
                by web browsers, although this property can be changed using the CSS
                text-decoration property. The "del" tag requires a starting and ending
                tag.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

            <p>
                <mark>Microsoft's biggest plan was to kill Linux</mark> by buying
                open-source software, so it bought GitHub, then introduced MS Azure, and now
                development is also done on Windows instead of Linux! Please think
                Microsoft doesn't sell data
                <strong><del>but that is absolutely wrong!</del></strong>
            </p>
