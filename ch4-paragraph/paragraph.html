			<h1>Ch4 - Paragraph in Html5</h1>

			<h2> Paragraph Tag - </h2>

			<pre> <!-- Pre tags are used to replace br tag. This tag let's the user present the intendation same as the user wrote in the code (spaces, commas, new lines etc.). Example - "I love html."  This text has spaces, fullstop, double inverted commas which migh not be visible same to same in normal html. To make them presentable excaly as we want, we use <pre> tag. -->
			</pre>

			<p>
				Paragraph in HTML5 are used a description to descript about something. It is
				made up of content — text, images, or other content like form fields — that
				appears between an opening tag and closing tag. Paragraphs belong to the
				class of elements called block-level elements.
			</p>

			<h2> Pre Tag - </h2>
			<p>
				<pre>
                	This is pre tag. This is used to add formattion in html5 document as predefined. 
                	It takes formatting from your text editor and applies ON your HTML5 document so that 
                	we do not need to manually apply them. Pre tag is also used to print code as we cannot write tags/code in our editor beause that will activate them and won't let us print them 
			on the display output.
         		</pre>
			</p>

			<h2> Br Tag - </h2>

			<p>
				BR tag is used to break lines.<br />
				<br />
				Example -
				Line before line break
				<br />
				<br />
				<!-- We used br tag to add 2 line break here in paragraph tag. -->
				Line after Line Break
