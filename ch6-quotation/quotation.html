			<h1>Ch6 - Quotation and Citation in Html5</h1>

			<h2> Quotation Tag - </h2>

			<p>
				Quotation tag is used to give quote someting. It's the same thing we do in
				English. In order to perform the same quotation, we use "q" tag in HTML 5.
				It defines a short quotation. Browsers normally insert quotation marks
				around the quotation
				Check the below example-
			</p>

			<br />

			<p>
				People believe thier data is not in wrong hand and are not sold.
				<q>
					Even big
					tech companies like Toogle, Suckrosoft and Basebook give their level best
					to
					prove the point.
				</q>
				But the reality is
				<strong>
					<q>OPPOSITE !!!
					</q>
				</strong>
				<i> Neither thier data is safe nor they are in right hands! </i>
			</p>

			<h2> Blockquote Tag - </h2>
			<p>
				In HTML and XHTML, the blockquote element defines "a section [within a
				document] that is quoted from another source. For example, there might be
				some situation where we require quotation from another
				author/book/website/more resources then we need to use <q>BLOCKQUOTE</q>
				tag/element.
