			<h1>Ch 2 - Comments</h1>
			<p>
				Comments are used to write notes, comment regarding the code (example - to explain why that specific line of code exists?), inform about something or to indicate
				something in the code.
				
				<br />
				
				It is <strong> extremely important to write comments
					for
					large and complex projects </strong> as it helps to understand the project
				and makes
				it easy to maintain it. <strong> Otherwise, it becomes very difficult and frustating for anyone to understand it, maintain it and do some changes if required. </strong>
