# HTML LEARNING
Learning and revising HTML 5 from TechGun Youtube channel. After the Learning is completed, I will be doing projects primilarly from freecodecamp.com then from youtube channel and other resourses which will be mentioned later on.

# WHAT IS THIS REPOSITORY/COURSE & WHY IT EXISTS?
This Repositiory exists to show potential clients, recuiters and relevent audience that Lalit does know HTMl and knows how to work on it which will gain trust of the people and eventully get him hired.

# HOW THIS REPO BENIFITS YOU?
This repo was created to document the learning process of HTMl in Chapter wise format so that any person from the world can Lean just by reading the chapters and practising small projects and assignments inside it. This not only **enables to help the worrld learn HTML5 easily but also helps LALIT to revise HTML in future.**
