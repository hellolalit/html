		<!-- This is H1, the largesr Heading tag : -->
		<h1>This is the largest Heading</h1>

		<!-- Br tag is used for line break and Hr tag is used for adding a horizontal
		straight line below the content for seperation. -->
		<hr />

		<h2>This is 2nd largest Heading</h2>
		<h3>This is 3rd largest Heading</h3>
		<h4>This is 4th largest Heading</h4>
		<h5>This is 5th largest Heading</h5>
		<!--This is h6, the smallest Heading tag : -->
